    "## Global Land Temperature - Data preprocessing\n",
    "The Global Land Temperature (GLT) dataset is a large collection of measurements actively maintained by Berkeley Earth. It contains the raw source data measured with stations all around the globe, plus anintermediate format and several formatted output files. Data span from ∼1750 up to recent days with monthly and daily availability. \n",
    "<br />\n",
    "Measurements are provided by hemispheres, states, countries, cities andmore. You can read more about the dataset at the Berkeley Earth website. For the purpose of this laboratory you will work on a modified, smaller but dirtier, version of the original GLT dataset, to stress the importance of data preprocessing. More specifically, this didactic version contains the formatted output files of the major cities of the globe with monthly granularity. For the sake of simplicity, the analysis will range between almost two centuries (i.e. between the years 1817 and 2012). The dataset is composed of∼200k rows corresponding to the measurements taken the first day of themonth in a given city. Each measurement is then described by 7 values:\n",
    "- Date, when the measurement was taken\n",
    "- AverageTemperature\n",
    "- AverageTemperatureUncertainty\n",
    "- City, from which the measurement was taken•\n",
    "- Country\n",
    "- Latitude\n",
    "- Longitude\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this exercise is to learn how to clean a real-world dataset searching for anomalies, suchas missing values or outliers, in its data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "1. Load the Global Land Temperature dataset as a list of lists. Before starting, take a moment to better inspect the attributes you are going to work on. How many of them are nominal, how many continuous or discrete?"

    "This exercise is meant to get you acquainted with the preprocessing of textual data. You can find useful information about Information Retrieval theory in the book \"Introduction to Information Retrieval\" (Manning, Raghavan, and Schütze 2008) also available at Introduction to Information Retrieval Stanford webpage. <br />\n",

    "Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is a popular online platform that gathers many information related tomultimed like movies, tv shows, video games and many more. You can navigate to its website to explore the huge amount of updated content it offers. The only difference with the previously used CSV datasetsis that, in this one, the first row of the file contains a “header” (i.e. the name of each column). You should skip the first row and start reading from the second one on. <br />\n",
    "IMDb has soon become a rich data source for the scientific community. Among the others, people’s reviews are one of the most important types of data that can be retrieved from the platform. The collection of reviews on a specific movie, for example, contains intrinsic information about its approval rating. Therefore, a considerable amount of recent science works has addressed the identification of the sentimentwithin textual reviews and surveys. In the context of movie reviews, the sentiment analysis would seek todiscover if the reviewer liked the movie or not based on the content of the text, with the sentiment being represented as numerical value (e.g. a score between 1 and 10) or a binary one (e.gPositiveorNegative). Wikipedia provides a general overview on the topic of sentiment analysis.During this laboratory you will work on the dataset collected and used by Maas et al. 2011. We will focus on a smaller portion of the whole dataset, known as the training data (you will learn more ontraining and test datasets). It contains 25,000 user reviews collected from IMDb for different movies.Since each review has also a numerical score between 1 and 10, the authors considered the ones witha score lower than 4 to have a negative sentiment, while the ones with a score higher than 6 to have apositive sentiment. The dataset includes12,500positive and12,500negative reviews. For the purpose ofthis laboratory, reviews, which originally came in different files, have been organized in a single CSV file.Each line of the file refers to a single review and has two fields:\n",
    "1. the textual comment\n",
    "2. a binary value indicating either the positive or negative sentiment, represented respectively by a ’1’and a ’0’.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "1. Load the IMDb dataset as a list of lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the rows have the same structure, the comment starts and ends with a \", and it is followed by the relative number. So we can use that structure for the extraction. "
